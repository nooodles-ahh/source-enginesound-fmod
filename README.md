# FMOD Source Sound Engine

THIS IS VERY WIP AND NOT IN ANY STATE TO BE ACTUALLY USED

This is intended to be a complete (mostly) drop in replacement for Source's sound engine. My final goal for this is full support for FMOD Studio and to integrate in Steam Audio.

# TODOs
[] Streaming Audio
[] Proper memory management
[] In-game speakers
[] Voice chat (This may be quite painful)
[] Auto DSP - Determine reverb based on characteristics of a space
[] FMOD Studio support
[] Save and restore
[] Phoneme loading and driving
[] Recreate existing DSP presets
[] Occlusion
[] Steam Audio
